# Tardy

This is a sample exercise to learn JavaScript / Google Scrips and code storage systems "clasp" and git. Github will allow for better version control, additional documentation and added project management features (issues, Wikis, Projects)

Sample code was taken from Google's GAS documentation. The code was working in a rough fashion before using the secret store procedure. Add an issue to the Github project for the current failure.
